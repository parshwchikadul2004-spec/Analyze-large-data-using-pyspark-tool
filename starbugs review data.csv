If I don’t make them open the cup before they hand it to me to verify the drink, I have to call and or go back through the drive thru to have them fix it.

More money is needed because now it is necessary to pay for a shot of espresso to put in the coffee, so it tastes like it did before the decision to make weaker coffee was made.

A few weeks ago, I was told that Starbucks no longer brews dark-roast coffee after 12:00 -- a corporate wide decision.  The young woman behind the counter told me that Starbucks had decided coffee drinkers didn't need the extra boost of dark roast in the afternoon and that the Pike's Peak brew would be sufficient.  Since when did Starbucks decide they could dictate what roast I want or need in the afternoon.  Sorry, but I prefer dark roast and will now look to other coffeehouses to satisfy my afternoon fix.
